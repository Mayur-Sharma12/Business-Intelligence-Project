Creating movies is no easy feat. Directors, actors, writers, and producers have to come together to develop a coherent and exciting story that will attract audiences. 
However, the fundamental question for film studios is not if a movie will become a critical success, but rather this: Will this film be profitable for our company? To help movie studios answer this question, we aim to analyze trends within the film industry. 
Specifically, we presented ourselves as consultants for Universal Pictures to help guide their executives and producers with developing their next film. 

Our goal is not to instruct Universal Pictures on how to make an upcoming movie. Instead, our final project’s objective is to provide information about the contemporary cinematic environment and identify key factors that affect a movie’s profitability to help Universal Pictures’ executives and producers make informed decisions about developing future films. We chose Tableau as our business intelligence platform. We then produced the following dashboards and data visualizations for Universal Pictures’ executives and producers. 

The movie industry is fast-paced, fast-changing, and expensive. This means that producers and executives need tangible, trustworthy data to make decisions that can keep up with artistic, cultural, and financial trends. With our dashboards and data visualizations, we believe that we can confidently provide our clients at Universal Pictures with an understanding of the contemporary film industry, as well as key factors to consider when assessing a future movie’s profitability. 

We hope that our business intelligence can help Universal Pictures produce a profitable film that entertains audiences.
